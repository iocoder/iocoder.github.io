            <li>
                I use a DELL inspiron notebook, and it has stupid proprietary firmware.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I use my preferred GNU/Linux distro, which is Arch Linux operating system.
                Almost all the software that i use is free and open-source.
                <br />
                Having a preference among all ethical GNU/Linux distros doesn't mean that I
                believe they are all bad, but trying them all would be a lot work that I have
                no need to do.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I use X11 for tasks that need graphics, but sometimes I
                use a text console. I find that the text console is more efficient
                for the bulk of the work I do, which is programming and text editing.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I spend most of my time editing in emacs and compiling with gcc.
                I love emacs, vim, and nano for editing text. In principle I would be glad
                to know about other free text processing software, but learning about them is
                not a priority for me and I don't have time.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also,
                I have no much experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
                In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
                about them is not a priority for me and I don't have time.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                This site is maitained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
                as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML and CSS.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I never used Unix (not even for a minute) until I decided to
                develop an operating system Quafios.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I have several free web browsers on my laptop, like links (CLI) and chromium
                (GUI).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                The most powerful programming language for me is C.
                If you don't know C, you don't appreciate what a powerful language is.
                Once you learn C you will see what is missing in most other languages.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                The programming languages I use are C, C++, and  Assembly.  They are
                also my favorite languages.  However, since around 2008 I have worked mainly
                on OS development, which means I am too busy to do much
                programming for Linux and Web.  As a result, I have not had time or
                occasion to learn newer languages such as Perl, Python, PHP or Ruby.
                <br />
                By contrast, I find C#.NET quite ugly.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I firmly refuse to install non-free software or tolerate its
                installed presence on my computer or on computers set up for me.
                <br />
                However, if I am visiting somewhere and the machines available
                nearby happen to contain non-free software, through no doing of
                mine, I don't refuse to touch them.  I will use them briefly for
                tasks such as browsing.  This limited usage doesn't give my assent
                to the software's license, or make me responsible its being present
                in the computer, or make me the possessor of a copy of it, so I
                don't see an ethical obligation to refrain from this.  Of course, I
                explain why they should migrate the machines to free software, but I
                don't push them hard, because that would be counterproductive.
                <br />
                Likewise, I don't need to worry about what software is in a kiosk,
                pay phone, or ATM that I am using.  I hope their owners migrate them
                to free software, for their sake, but there's no need for me to
                refuse to touch them until then.  (I do consider what those machines
                and their owners might do with my personal data, but that's a
                different issue.  My response to that issue is to minimize those
                activities which give them any data about me.)
                <br />
                That reasoning is based on the fact that I was not responsible for
                setting up those machines, or for how that was done.  By contrast,
                if I were to ask or lead someone to set up a computer for me to use,
                that would make me ethically responsible for its software load.  In
                such a case I insist on free software, just as if the machine were
                mine.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
               I mainly use Google's search engine.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I have a Twitter account called iocoder,
                but I don't post on Twitter so much.
                Any other Twitter account that claims to be mine is an impostor.
