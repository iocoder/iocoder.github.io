        <h1>Static RAM in MOSFETs</h1>
        <h3>Feb 27th, 2014</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM">Random Access Memory</a>
            (RAM)
            is one of the fundamental components of computers.
            It is used to store
            program's
            temporary data during computer runtime.
            Furthermore,
            RAM
            is usually used to store the program itself besides the data in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer">stored-program computers</a>
            in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann architecture</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern RAM is made of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">semiconductors</a>
            such as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistors</a>
            like
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal-oxide-semiconductor">MOS</a>
            as well as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor">capacitors</a>,
            both of which are usually embedded together in an
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Circuit">integrated circuits</a>.
            We usually classify the semiconductor RAMs in two categories:
            <ul>
                <li>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory">Static RAM</a>
                (SRAM):
                implemented using typical
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">flip flop</a>
                memory cells.
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM">Dynamic RAM</a>
                (DRAM):
                capacitors are used to store data.
                Only one transistor and a capacitor are
                needed to store one bit.
                Therefore it is less expensive and widely used
                (example:
                The PC).
                One disadvantage is that DRAM needs
                to be refreshed periodically because the capacitors lose
                their data after a little time due to current leaks.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to gain deep understanding of how
            semiconductor RAMs are organized
            and how they work from the inside, I, along with a group of
            hardworker students at CSED, decided to create a static RAM with
            discrete MOSFETs. We submitted this project for EE 236
            (Electronics) course and it got the highest ranking among
            the class.
        </p>
        <h2>Phase 1: CAD and Simulation</h2>
        <p>
            We simulated two models:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                <b>Model A</b>:
                Each memory cell is made of a typical S-R
                latch. The latch consisted of two cross-coupled
                inverters and two access transistors.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <b>Model B:</b>
                Each memory cell is made of a typical
                6T CMOS memory cell and the bitslice is organized
                in the same manner of VLSI RAMs but
                with discrete MOSFETs instead.
            </p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Model A</h3>
        <p>
            This one was easy to understand because it was direct
            application to what we had studied in both Electronics and
            Digital Systems courses.
            We used Proteus to design and simulate this model.
            The structural unit for this
            model was the CMOS AND, OR and NOT gates:
        </p>

            <img src="../img/or_gate.png" width="800px" /></a>
            <BR />

            CMOS NOT gate (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            We have also created a tristate buffer with
            to be used to bring the outputs of the RAM to high impedence
            CE or OE are off:

            Tristate buffer (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            As explained above, the S-R latch for this model
            is typically two cross-couples inverters with two access
            transistors:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/sr_latch.png">
            <img src="../img/sr_latch.png" width="800px" /></a>
            <BR />
            The S-R latch (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            The memory cell consists of the S-R latch and
            enable/disable logic circuit for input and output
            (a gated S-R latch):
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">

            <BR />
            The memory cell (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            The bit-slice can be simply constructed from
            those gated S-R latches as described in chapter 12 of
            "Principles of Computer Hardware":
        </p>

            <BR />
            Bitslice of 8 cells (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            A decoder was made to decode the address. The design
            of such CMOS decoders is well explained by Sedra:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/decoder3.png">
            <img src="../img/decoder3.png" width="800px" /></a>
            <BR />
            3-to-8 decoder (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            By connecting the decoder to a bitslice, we had a
            working 8-bit RAM. More bitslices can be added up
            easily to enlarge the capacity of the RAM and
            widen the word size. Unfortunately,
            We couldn't add any more bitslices as simulation
            needed very high processing power.

        <p>
            We tested the design and it worked as expected (after
            some debugging). Finally, we encapsulated the design into
            this little black box:

        </p>
        <h3>Model B</h3>
        <p>
            The structural unit for this model was a typical 6T CMOS
            memory cell which is well explained in Sedra. We used
            Multisim to design and simulate this model. We spent
            a lot of time debugging and testing this model at
            Engineers' Club in Saba Basha, Alexandria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the discrete transistors that we used had different
            characteristics from CMOS transistors on VLSI chips, we had
            to make a unit which we called (access transistor). The
            access transistor unit consisted of two NMOS transistors connected
            as shown below. This access transistor lets the current
            passes between S and D when the gate is
            high (no matter what the voltages on S and D are).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/access_tran.png" />
            <BR />
            Access transistor
        </p>
        <p>
            We then made the CMOS inverter that would be used
            to build the memory cell:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/inverter1.png">
            <img src="../img/inverter1.png" width="600" /></a>
            <BR />
            CMOS inverter (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            By connecting two cross-coupled inverters with
            the access transistors, we obtained a typical 6T memory cell.
            Notice that this cell is different from the memory cell
            in model A. If wordline is high, the transistor will be
            connected to the bitlines for read/write operations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/memcell1.png">
            <img src="../img/memcell1.png" width="600" /></a>
            <BR />
            Memory Cell (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            Memory cells were organized together to make a bitslice:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/bitslice2.png">
            <img src="../img/bitslice2.png" width="800" /></a>
            <BR />
            Bitslice (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            The bitslice had a bitline conditioning circuitry to
            precharge the bitlines with high voltage before reads:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">

            <BR />
            Bitline conditioning circuit (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            We also made a decoder, just like Model A:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/decoder1.png">

            <BR />
            CMOS decoder (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we connected the bitslice with the decoder
            to obtain the RAM:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/block_tot.png">
            <img src="../img/block_tot.png" width="600" /></a>
            <BR />
            The RAM (click on the image to enlarge)
        </p>
        <h2>Phase 2: Realization</h2>
        <p>
            Realizing a big RAM in MOSFETs needs too many
            transistors and too much work, so we settled for a
            physical RAM with two flip flops and a decoder (all in
            MOSFETs of course). We used Eagle to design the PCB boards.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/decoder4.png">

            The decoder PCB
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, I don't have photos for the decoder board
            but I have got some photos for the flip flop PCB:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/pcb1.jpg">
            <img src="../img/pcb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/pcb2.jpg">
            <img src="../img/pcb2.jpg" width="400" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The other flip flop was realized on a breadboard:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/bb1.jpg">
            <img src="../img/bb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/bb2.jpg">
            <img src="../img/bb2.jpg" width="400" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's amazing how our
            flip-flop "memorizes" its state and how
            it can be switched between ON and OFF states. The wires
            to be activated are the S and R signals.
            When S is high and R is low, Q goes high and the
            LED associated with Q becomes ON. If S is low and R
            is high, Q goes low and the LED associated with Q` becomes ON
            (Q becomes OFF).
            When S and R are both low, the value of Q "remains"
            in the latest state.
            This behavior is a typical <b>bistable multivibrator</b>.
