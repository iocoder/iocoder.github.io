                           Well... First of all, why have you just assumed my gender?
                           Why you people like to use 'she' all the time, but shift to
                           'he' when you are angry at me? I accept all pronouns of
                           course, but I don't accept to be called an 'EFI supporter'!

                           I admit I use (and write code for) UEFI 2.8 and earlier UEFI
                           versions as well, and I also admit that I am not using/coding
                           BIOS anymore. But I have a reason. A strong reason. You
                           people need to stop judging me and use your brain for a
                           minute please!

                           <br />
                           <br />

                           UEFI is just an open standard, just like the open USB
                           standard which was also founded by a similar proprietary
                           consortium! We support the USB standard because it provides
                           a standardized way to implement the protocol without any
                           trade secrets or binary blobs involved.

                           I was never a supporter of Secure Boot. I migrated to UEFI,
                           not because of Secure Boot, but only because it is now
                           a de-facto standard for PC firmware, and at the same time
                           it can be fully implemented as free and open-source software.
                           What is the advantage of using BIOS, including open-source
                           implementations like SeaBIOS, while we have open-source
                           UEFI available, and it does the job much better then
                           legacy BIOS?

                           8086 was a 1970s thing. I shouldn't be
                           writing bunch of real and protected mode code in order
                           to boot my kernel or code a system-level application. With
                           UEFI, I can write my x86_64 code and load it in memory
                           just like any program, yet have full control of the RAM
                           and of the machine, you can even wipe RAM allocated for UEFI
                           code and data! BIOS needs a lot of unnecessary assumptions.
                           By 2020, BIOS has officially become a pain in the... neck.
