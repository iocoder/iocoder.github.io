        <h1>NES Simulator</h1>
        <h3>Sep 3rd, 2014</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>
            clone is implemented in VHDL and uploaded to Nexys 2 board.
            NES/Famicom is certainly one of the coolest game consoles ever.
            NES devices, games, and simulators are available everywhere
            nowadays. It's really enjoyable to see the video games that
            I used to play in my childhood running on an architecture
            of my own design. This lets me understand how these games
            and NES work from the inside. This answers the question
            "How do these things really work?" that I used to
            ask myself everytime I used NES in my childhood. BTW I am
            still playing NES games. I use a NES simulator called
            <a href="http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/">nestopia</a>
            on GNU/Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that I am not the first one to do this. It doesn't
            add anything to the world, but it adds to my knowledge;
            This is an enough reason to go ahead on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technically, NES mainly consists of these components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                chip,
                which contains a
                second-sourced
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a>
                processor,
                the APU
                (audio processing unit),
                DMA controller,
                and game controller logic.
            </li>

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Processing_Unit">RP2C02</a>
                chip,
                which contains the PPU
                (picture processing unit),
                with an internal
                256-byte
                RAM
                for
                sprites
                and an internal
                32-byte
                RAM
                for
                color palette.
            </li>
            <li>
                A 2KB RAM for programs.
            </li>
            <li>
                A 2KB RAM for name tables and attribute tables.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game cartridges contain a
                program ROM,
                an optional
                RAM,
                and a
                VRAM/VROM
                to store
                patterns.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The project is two phases. Phase 1 is to implement a simulator
            in C. This simulator allowed me to understand the hardware
            correctly before I start working on the FPGA. Phase 2
            is to implement the machine in VHDL and get it to work
            on Nexys 2.
        </p>
        <h2>The simulator</h2>
        <p>
            I started working on the simulator in July 2014. The first
            step was to write a 6502 emulator. Debugging the 6502
            emulator wasn't easy... I had to run some NES games and
            expect how should they behave, then watch how they
            actually behave on my emulator (instruction by instruction).
            There was a little bug in the tax instruction (and her sisters)
            that drove me crazy for two days until I found it (I forgot
            to modify the Z and N registers on the termination of tax, and
            this made the games do very unexpected things xD). It was
            exciting when the games started to behave correctly using
            the simulator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next step was to implement the cartridge logic, a parser
            for .nes files, memory, etc... The PPU was an important
            part. I first wrote a PPU that paints the patterns of
            Contra on screen. It started to behave correctly when
            I solved the bug issues of the 6502 simulator.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim1.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Then implemented the name table logic:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim2.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim3.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, I implemented the palette logic:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim5.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim4.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, the sprites, scrolling, game
            controller logic, etc...
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim6.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/nessim7.png" width="600px" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually, there are some bugs in the APU and the PPU,
            but I chose to work on the hardware implementation first,
            then work on these bugs when I have free time. The
            main objective from the simulator was to understand
            the internals of NES before going into the hardware, not
            to replace nestopia and other simulators. Therefore
            those bugs are not important now.
        </p>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            Working on the 6502 emulator provided me with good
            knowledge of the details of 6502. This helped me
            implement my own 6502 clone in VHDL.
            Details about the processor can be found at the
            <a href="6502.html">6502 computer on FPGA</a> article.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to work on the PPU, which
            will be based on the CRT controller of
            <a href="6502.html">6502
            computer on FPGA</a>. The project was aborted.
