        <h1>Hello World BIOS</h1>
        <h3>Aug 30th, 2013</h3>
        <p>
            Some night (during Summer 2013, as I was a CS freshman)
            while I was sleeping, I dreamed that I
            wrote a BIOS and managed to run it on a computer
            (perhaps my PC)...
            Next morning I decided to make it real. So I wrote
            this small BIOS that just prints "I am BIOS!" on screen.

            Actually, it was not really easy to achieve this.
            I had to learn about a lot of details that the PC BIOS
            hides from systems programmers. The Hello World BIOS
            consisted of 2 parts: Protected Mode Code and VGA
            driver. The VGA driver initializes the VGA and brings it
            into a functional text mode with 80x25 chars. This
            was my first direct interaction with the VGA hardware
            and registers. It was interesting when it finally worked!
            Here is a screenshot from QEMU ($ qemu -bios bios.bin):
