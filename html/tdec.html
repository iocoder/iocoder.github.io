        <h1>Simulated Computer Design using TTL, T-DEC/102</h1>
        <h3>Mar 31st, 2014</h3>
        <p>
            T-DEC/102
            is a simulated computer project.
            T-DEC
            stands for
            <B>Turing-Digital Electronic Computer</B>.
            I decided to use this name in memory of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>,
            the father of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>.
            The number 102 is the result of subtracting 1912
            (the year when Alan Turing was born)
            from 2014
            (the year when this project was done).
        </p>
        <p>
            T-DEC/102 was built with TTL chips on Proteus. I chose TTL to have
            the feeling that people who designed
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC</a>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX">VAX</a>
            (and similar systems)
            had :D
            As you can see,
            it is a simulated machine;
            I used Proteus to design and simulate
            T-DEC.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was finished in March 2014, just before
            my forth semester in CSED started.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical details</h2>
        <p>
            T-DEC/102 consists of the following components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            The processor, which has eight 8-bit registers
            (named R0-->R7), a 16-bit address bus, an 8-bit data bus,
            an 8-function 8-bit ALU, and a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode">microprogrammed</a>
            control unit. The microprogram consists of 128 micro-operations.
            A micro-assembler was written in C to compile the microcode.
            </li>
            <li>2KB SRAM.</li>
            <li>3-to-8 address decoder.</li>
            <li>
            Two
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8255">8255</a>
            Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI)
            chips to interface a keypad and 8 seven-segment LEDs.
            </li>
            <li>
            The operating system, which was written in T-DEC/102
            assembly language, and was installed on a ROM chip.
            An assembler was written in C to compile the OS. The OS
            contains a calculator program, which takes inputs from
            the keypad, and outputs results to the seven-segment LEDs.
            It also contains device drivers for the PPIs, the keypad,
            and the seven-segment LEDs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>T-DEC/102 instruction set architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The first step in the project was to design the macro
            architecture. T-DEC would be mainly used for doing math
            (ADD, SUB, etc...). I tried to reduce the ISA as
            much as I could in order to minimize TTL logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final design, I came up with 10 different instruction
            formats:
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, the highest 4 bits of BYTE0
            can be used to identify the instruction format and
            decode the instruction. For example, if they
            are 01xx, then it is obviously a branch instruction
            in register-indirect addressing mode. On the other hands,
            It is a store instruction in absolute addressing mode
            if the bits are 1011.
        </p>
        <p>
            T-DEC/102 is little endian. Thus BYTE0 is fetched
            before BYTE1 and BYTE2. ALUOP is signaled to the ALU unit during
            the execution phase of ALU instructions. It simply indicates
            which ALU operation should be activated. CONCODE indicates
            the conditions that must be met so that the branch
            instruction modifies the value of PC.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The second step of the project was to implement the ISA
            using TTL chips. I started with the architectural register
            file, which looked like this in the final design:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/31_regfile.png">
            <img src="../img/31_regfile.png" width="800px" /></a>
            <BR />
            R0-->R7 (click on the image for full size)
        </p>
        <p>
            I then designed the data path of the processor, and
            the internal registers (IR, MAR, Flags, ...)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <a href="../img/30_registers.png">
            <img src="../img/30_registers.png" width="800px" /></a>
            <BR />
            Internal registers and datapath (click on the image for full size)
        </p>
        <p>
            Most registers have READ signals and WRITE signals attached
            to OE and LE pins. READ signal allows the register to
            put its data on the data bus (when READ is off, the LS373
            latches are in tri-state). WRITE signal allows the
            register to latch the data on the data bus. All these
            signals are connected to the control unit which controls them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ALU is pretty simple and doesn't need much explanation:

            The control unit was very challenging to me because
            it was my first time to do such thing. The control
            unit consists of 4 ROMs, 3 latches (to treat
            the ROM glitches), and a sequencer. The ROMs store
            the microprogram which is explained below. The outputs
            of the ROM are the control signals of current
            micro-operation. The fetched opcode and
            the flags state are signaled to the control unit as input
            as they control the flow of the micropogram.

            SRAM, the firmware ROM, two PPIs, keypad, and 8
            seven-segment LEDs. This is the top-level schematic
            of the machine:

        <h2>Microprogramming</h2>
        <p>
            The microprogramming part was very interesting. In order
            to write the microprogram, I had to create the RTL language
            in which the microprogram would be written. I came up
            with a pretty simple grammar. Register transfers are written
            like this:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/micro01.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            As example, the first line means that MAR0Write and PC0Read
            signals will be
            on when this micro-operation is selected by the sequencer.
            To describe the branches that occur inside the microprogram,
            I created this simple syntax:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/micro02.png" />
        </p>

            I decided to give If statements a higher priority over Goto
            statements if "If" follows "Goto". Therefore "Goto fetch"
            will never occur unless if all the immediately-following
            "If" statements don't meet the conditions. Confusing, right?
            I just wanted to simplify the code that will
            translate this microprogram into zeros and ones :D

            Labels should appear at separate lines. A label must
            be followed by a colon. Comments start with hashes:

            I ended up with 128 micro-operations. I wrote a simple
            micro-assembler in C to translate the microprogram
            into binary. The microassembler works
            in two passes to solve the forward references.
            I then configured Proteus to load the compiled microcode
            onto the four ROMs. Of course, things didn't work out of
            the blue. There was a lot of debugging on all levels:
            the hardware logic, the microprogram, the microassembler,
            the assembler, and the OS.

        <h2>T-DEC/102 Assembler</h2>
        <p>
            T-DEC/102 assembly is pretty easy. All instructions
            have two operands and are written in this form: "MNEMONIC
            OPERAND1, OPERAND2".  ADD, SUB, MOV,
            and JZ (Jump if zero flag on) are examples for valid mnemonics.
            Each operand maybe an immediate, a register, a memory address,
            a label, or two registers used as memory address
            (MOV R0, [R1:R2] ; Address stored in both R1 and R2).
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve flexible, the programmer doesn't have to care about
            the details of ISA (like instruction classes).
            MOV R6, R7 and MOV R6, [0x100] may seem to you as if they
            are the same instruction with different addressing modes. But
            actually, they are totally different instructions (see the
            instruction set architecture section above). The assembler
            identifies the instruction class using a lookup table:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/asm.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The assembler is used to compile the OS. It generates
            a binary file that contains a T-DEC/102 executable
            program which is to be loaded on the firmware ROM.
            When T-DEC/102 is powered on, it fetches
            and executes the instructions from the firmware ROM
            through the external system bus.
        </p>
        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>
            This is the highest level of the project. The firmware ROM
            appears at 0x0000 memory address, so I adjusted the OS to that
            region. When T-DEC is powered on, PC is 0x0000. The OS
            bootloader is automatically executed and it goes
            into the following sequence:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Initialize R0-->R5 registers with zeros.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                R6 and R7 are used as a stack pointer for the call stack
                of the operating system. I give them an initial value.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Initialize the PPIs. CALL() is a macro that pushes current
                PC to the stack and then jumps to the desired routine.
                I used the awsome
                <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>
                macroprocessor for manipulating these macros.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Two 32-bit words of the SRAM are called "accumulator", and
                "operand". They are used by the calculator program. The OS
                initializes them to zero.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The OS then updates the seven-sgement LEDs so that the
                accumulator and the operand are shown on them.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The calculator is finally executed and it takes control.
                It keeps reading the inputs from the keyboard driver
                and appends it to "operand".
                When "+" or "-" is hit, the operand is added to/subtracted
                from the accumulator. When "=" is pressed, the operand is
                copied to the accumulator.
                The calculator keeps updating the
                LEDs on every key press.
            </p></li>

            It was exciting to see my assembly code assembled by
            an assembler of my own, and executed by a machine of my
            design :)
            The experience made me aware of a lot of technical
            details about what happens inside the computer.
            It shows you how hardware and software interact together
            and how they cooperate.

            Here is a screenshot of a sample run. The number in blue is
            actually the accumulator. The other number is the operand.
            The calculator program is running and waiting for a key press.
