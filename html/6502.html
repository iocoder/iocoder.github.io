            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502"
               target="_blank">6502</a> is a pretty interesting
               microprocessor designed by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Peddle"
               target="_blank">Chuck Peddle</a> and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mensch"
               target="_blank">Bill Mensch</a> and released in 1975.
            Obviously, the processor was introduced as an inexpensive
            replacement for

        <p>
            6502 has an 8-bit architecture with 16-bit address lines.
            It has three index registers (X, Y, and stack pointer) plus
            the accumulator, the 16-bit program counter, and the flag
            register. 6502 supports 13 addressing modes.
        </p>
        <p>
            My project is to implement these components and combine
            them together as usable computer system:

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            While I was doing some experiment at the Digital Systems Lab of 
            my school (Lab 304, Electrical Engineering Building),
            I picked up the manual of a spartan-3 board and read it. It had
            a section that talked about VGA timings and how CRT worked.
            I was then so interested to design and implement this CRT
            controller myself. Then I came up with the idea to design
            a sequencer, a two-port frame buffer, a color palette module,
            and a graphics controller, and to connect them together so that
            they behave exactly like the famous text-mode 0xb8000 buffer in
            the IBM PC world when they are interfaced to a CPU.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following summer, I got a Nexys 2 board and implemented
            the VGA controller. It was very fun to design and debug
            a VGA. I thought about using it as a base for the PPU of the
            <a href="nes.html">NES</a> project. I also decided to use it
            whenever I would implement a computer in VHDL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to design a computer in VHDL since I knew
            about VHDL. I thought about implementing a MIPS, but
            while I was working on <a href="nes.html">NES</a>, 6502
            took all of my mind! I loved it; so I decided to implement
            one 6502 module for both <a href="nes.html">NES</a> project and
            this one.
        </p>
        <h2>The VGA-compatible controller</h2>
        <p>
            As explained above, the VGA controller was implemented before
            the processor and other components. I started with a simple CRT
            controller that generates a 640x480 image with all pixels yellow.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/vga01.jpg" width="450px" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Next step was to implement other components. The final design
            looked like the original design by IBM, but this one is
            much more simpler. Working on this design let me understand
            how the IBM VGA worked internally, and how 0xA0000-0xBFFFF
            memory accesses in the IBM PC-compatible computers are handled
            by hardware. I was excited when some glitches
            (caused by propagation delays in the circuit) appeared
            on the CRT screen, LOL! I could finally erase them in the
            final design.

            I implemented a module that allowed to write to the VGA memory
            using the switches and buttons on Nexys 2 board. Here
            are the results:

            <BR />
            board with the help of ASCII tables available online.

        <h2>The 6502 processor</h2>
        <p>
            I started working on the 6502 processor for both
            <a href="../nes">NES</a> and this project as explained above.
            Actually, It was my first experience to work on a processor in
            VHDL. I wrote a prototype that supported some little addessing
            modes and instructions, then interfaced it with the VGA and
            a 256-byte RAM in the following manner (all in VHDL):
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <img src="../img/c01.png" width="400px" />
            <BR />
            Initial design for the computer.
        </p>
        <p>My sister wrote a simple boot loader for the machine. The loader
           simply writes the word "Hello" to the VGA memory at $C000 then
           halts. I assembled the loader using
           <a href="http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/"
              target="_blank">ACME</a> (6502 ISA is straightforward, you
           can assemble the program manually) then loaded it to
           the 256x8 RAM. Here are the results:

            "Hello", printed by the boot loader.

        </p>
        <p>
            Because the initial design of the CPU was too lousy,
            I decided to redesign the processor in a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode"
               target="_blank">microprogrammed</a> fashion (just like
            <a href="../tdec102">T-DEC/102</a>). Here is the final design
            for the CPU:
        </p>

            The ALU supports 8 operations: ADD, SUB, SHL, SHR,
            BIT, AND, OR, and EOR. The ALU has two sides, X (16-bit)
            and Y (8-bit). Y is casted to a 16-bit signed number if
            REP is 1 (if Y is $8F and REP=1, then Y is casted to $FF8F).
            Some instructions, like conditional branching
            instructions, make use of REP to add a signed 8-bit number
            (branch offset) to a 16-bit number (PC). AOP selects which
            ALU operation is to be activated. bit 0 of AOP activates
            the ADD operation, bit 1 activates the SUB, etc... Cin
            is the value of carry in/borrow in used by ADD/SUB/SHL/SHR
            circuits. The ALU was first written in VHDL and then tested:

            ALU simulation.

        <p>
            The control unit consists of the microprogram ROM, along
            with a lookup table and sequencing logic. The lookup
            table contains the addresses of macro-instructions.
            For example, The BEQ instruction (opcode: $F0) starts
            at address $0417 in the microprogram memory. If the
            input of the lookup table is $F0, the output is simply
            $0417. You can now deduce the input of the lookup
            table is directly connected to IR, and the output
            is connected to the sequencer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microinstructions are 16-bit wide and have 4 formats:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                <b>REG</b>: An ordinary register transfer microinstruction.
                The microinstruction simply contains the state
                of control signals (encoded to minimize instruction
                width). After the micro-instruction is executed,
                the sequencer will increase by 1 to execute the
                next instruction.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <b>LOOKUP</b>: This microinstruction tells the sequencer
                to be updated with the value of the output of
                lookup table, instead of being increased by 1.
                After a lookup microinstruction, SEQ=LOOKUP_OUTPUT+OFFSET
                where OFFSET is a 3-bit value encoded in the
                micro-instruction word.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <b>JUMP IF 0</b>: This micro-instruction tells the
                sequencer to be updated with an 11-bit address encoded
                in the micro-instruction word iff the flag x is 0.
                We have 8 flags that can be tested (1, C, Z, N, V,
                NMI, IRQ, and 0). IRQ is always 0 if I is 1. A flag
                is selected by a 3-bit value encoded in the instruction word.
                If the value of the selected flag is not 0,
                SEQ will be increased by 1.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <b>JUMP IF 1</b>: Just like the JUMP IF 0, but
                the value of the selected flag is compared with 1 instead.
            </p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The microprogram</h2>
        <p>
            As for <a href="../tdec102">T-DEC/102</a>, I wrote
            my own micro-assembler with its own formal language.
            REG microinstructions are written like this:
            <b>[SRC] &lt-- [DEST]</b>,
            while JUMP IF 0/1 instructions are written like this:
            <b>If (C = YES) Goto LABEL</b>. Goto statements
            are allowed to be used without If, in this case the
            micro-assembler will translate them to
            <b>If (TRU = YES) Goto LABEL</b>, where TRU is the flag
            that always has the value of 1 (see above).
            LOOKUP statements are written like this: <b>LOOKUP+i</b> where
            i is the offset which can be any number less than 8.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main
            task of the micro-assembler is to translate these statements
            to the binary format described above, so that the control
            unit can understand the microcode and execute it properly.
            As usual, I used the beautiful macro processor,
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/"
               target="_blank">GNU M4</a>,
            to simplify the job of the micro-assembler. The output
            of the microassembler is a binary file that is loaded
            directly into the microprogram ROM inside the CPU, as well
            as the
            lookup table that is loaded into the lookup ROM inside the CPU.
            Both ROMs are implemented as block RAMs on the FPGA chip.
        </p>
        <p>
            The microprogram implements the 56 macro-instructions of 6502,
            along with the 13 addessing modes supported by the original
            6502 microprocessor. It also implements the logic for RESET and
            NMI interrupts. IRQ logic and BRK instruction are TBD.

        <h2>On-board memory interface</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to use the RAM and ROM chips on Nexys-2 board to
            store the operating system and its temporary data. In order
            to install the OS on the on-board ROM, The Makefile
            first programs the FPGA chip on the Nexys-2 board using
            BIST.bit from Digilent (It can be downloaded from their
            website, visit the
            <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Nexys2/"
               target="_blank">Nexys2 product page</a> and scroll down
            to "support documents" section).
        </p>
        <p>
            BIST.bit provides an EPP interface for programming the ROM
            and RAM chips on the board. I wrote a C program that communicates
            with this interface through EPP protocol (over USB). The
            Makefile will compile this C program and execute it. The
            program erases the ROM and then installs the firmware on
            the ROM. This procedure takes several seconds. Refer to
            upload/ directory in the source code for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to interface the CPU with both ROM and RAM chips,
            I wrote a memory controller in VHDL which interfaced the CPU
            bus from one side, and the ROM/RAM chips through the other side.
            16KB of RAM appears at the address range ($0000-$3FFF), 8KB
            of RAM appears at the VGA address space ($6000-$7FFF). When
            the running program writes to VGA, both VGA and RAM are
            written. When the running program reads from VGA address space,
            only RAM is read, because VGA doesn't support this. 32KB
            of ROM appears at ($8000-$FFFF), This 32KB region contains the
            operating system which is loaded there as described above.
        </p>
        <h2>PS/2 controller</h2>
        <p>
            The PS/2 Controller is so simple, it consists of a debouncer and
            a finite state machine that listens to scancodes sent
            by the keyboard. When a button is pressed/released, the keyboard
            sends a scancode through the serial PS/2 cable, and the FSM
            triggers an interrupt, which is connect to the NMI input of
            the CPU. On the next fetch cycle,
            the CPU sends a NAK (NMI ACK) signal.
            The keyboard controller releases the interrupt signal
            when it receives the NAK, and then the CPU releases the
            NAK as well. Finally, the CPU
            jumps to the NMI routine pointed to by the vector stored
            at $FFFA, after pushing PCH, PCL, and P registers.

               target="_blank">cc65</a>
            is one of the most beautiful compiler projects in
            this world. I obtained the source code of the run-time
            library of cc65, and edited it to be compatible with
            my machine, then wrote the OS in both C and assembly, then
            compiled it with cc65 compiler and assembler. After some
            debugging, everything worked well! The cc65 compiler translates
            C code into assembly, so that you can easily study the output
            of the compiler, this helped me understanding the source
            code of the run-time library. I chose to write the OS in C
            and assembly (instead of only assembly) to save time. The
            OS consists of the following modules:
            <ul>
                <li>Initialization program</li>
                <li>VGA device driver</li>
                <li>PS/2 keyboard device driver</li>
                <li>Shell</li>
                <li>Simple calculator</li>
                <li>Simple memory debugger</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Emulator</h2>
        <p>
            To test the OS, I wrote an emulator that simulates the
            microcode and the computer/cpu design shown above. The
            emulator has the option to dump the memory image to
            help me debugging the system. Here is a screen-shot
            of the operating system running on the emulator:
