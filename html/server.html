         How does this website work?
      </h2>
      <p class="text">
         This website is made of a collection of HTML, CSS, and images/pdf
         files that are manually written in

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnc">HTML</a>

         (no

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5BTPS2p7k">wix</a>

         involved, lol!). The source code is organized and stored in
         a git repo on my home server. A mirror is hosted by github,
         which I use as a remote origin:

         <a href="https://github.com/iocoder/iocoder.github.io"
         >iocoder.github.io</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         Taking care of the details of

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnc">HTML</a>

         and

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnd">CSS</a>

         helps me develop a website that can work well on most of HTML2 web
         browsers, and make sure it is not bloated by unnecessary piles of

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pne">Javascript</a>

         and hidden content. That being said, this website doesn't have any
         embedded Javascript/VBScript nor any

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnf">client-side</a>

         code. Similarly, all the pages are purely written in the standard
         markup language (HTML), and no

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Png">server-side</a>

         code is executed (no

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pni">PHP</a>,

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnh">Ruby on Rails</a>,

         etc.) to dynamically generate the web content (i.e. all the content
         on this website is static).

         Where is this website hosted?
      </h2>
      <p class="text">
         This website is hosted on my home server. It is
         stored under a directory on my disk, and web-server
         software is set up to listen to port 80 and port 443.
         The domain name

         <a href="https://ramses.ca">ramses.ca</a>

         is registered by

         <a href="https://w.wiki/PnV">Canadian Internet Registration
         Authority</a>

         (CIRA) through an intermediate registrar.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         When you type the URL

         <a href="https://ramses.ca">ramses.ca</a>

         in your browser's address bar and hit Enter, your browser makes a

         <a href="https://w.wiki/EGX">DNS request</a>

         to resolve the name ramses.ca. The request is passed to my

         <a href="https://w.wiki/PnU">registrar</a>

         by the Internet DNS system. Next, my registrar
         resolves the name into my IP address. This IP address
         is basically the address of my landlord's gateway
         router at the basement of our lovely family house. All
         HTTP/HTTPS requests that your browser makes are then
         delivered to my computer upstairs through a

         <a href="https://w.wiki/PnT">NAT</a>.

         By visiting this page, you have just made
         a direct access to my home server. Congratulations!
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         In Layman's terms, when you open my website on your
         browser, your browser directly sends a request to my
         home computer, and my home computer answers that request
         by sending back the required content directly to your
         machine. This is basically how the

         <a href="https://w.wiki/PnX">Internet</a>

         works.

         What are the specs of your machine?
      </h2>
      <p class="text">
         The hardware itself is powerful enough for my use cases. I have
         built the machine in May 2019 (I was living in Ottawa
         by that time). I primarily use a

         <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/core_i9/i9-9900k">Core
         i9 9900K</a>

         CPU. I have always been impressed by the great performance of this
         chip. Motherboard is

         <a
         href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/Z390-AORUS-MASTER-rev-10"
         >Gigabyte Z390 AORUS Master</a>

         which I highly admire! It's an advanced board with artistic design.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         For the RAM, I use

         <a href="https://www.gskill.com/products/1/165/166/Trident-Z-RGB"
         >G SKill TridentZ RGB</a> DDR4 units, with a total of 32GB. Most
         of the time, only 2.5GB is used by the software and the Linux
         Kernel.

         Finally, for the storage, I use a 1TB

         <a href="https://samsung.com/ca/ssd/">Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus</a>

         chip. The compilation of high-performance i9 CPU, DDR4 RAM,
         PCIe, and M.2 SSD leaves me so satisfied with the overall performance
         of the machine.

         This is cool, my friend. What software do you use?

         My server primarily runs

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pno">Centos Linux</a>.

         Yes I am a big fan of

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnp">KDE 4</a>

         which looks and feels much better than the ugly

         <a href="https://w.wiki/Pnq">Plasma 5</a> (way too flat!).

         I mean, what is the point of a gui that doesn't provide you
         with anything except flat squares and flat boxes?! Compare
         the look of
